=============================

What is PITC mew?
-------------
mew is a addon script for PITC/PITCBots, mew is an easy to setup, amusing and playful AI bot.
The bot is female and likes to play and be cute (According to everyone)

What does PITC mew require?
-----------------------
mew requires the following:
	- PITC_Bots (https://github.com/tmfksoft/PITC-BOT)
	- PHP5+ (php5)

Setup
-----
Place all files in the root of your PITC-Bots client and edit mew.php to change $admin to your nickname.
Mew's core triggers are stored in data/core.mew I hope to completely move actions into such a format.
Change $debug to false in mew.php if you wish to cut down the spam of mew in the console.

Credits

Aha2y - Creating the Uptime Script http://www.hawkee.com/snippet/9711/ which has been intergrated into PITC v1.1 and replaces the Uptime CTCP with new code, also adds the function string_duration();
macwolf74 - For downloading a version of mew that unearthed a lot of errors and bugs in PITCBots.
Everyone in my IRC Channel - mew has been modeled to amuse all ~20 people in my IRC Channel

PITC mew is Opensource! I'm going to steal it and call it my own!
-------------------------------------------------------------
No you're not. PITC mew is OpenSource but you HAVE to give credit
if you decide to fork and create your own AI Bot from mew,
this code has been created by myself (Thomas Edwards) and is
my own work not yours! It currently IS on GitHub so it will start
to comprimise of other peoples work. Credit those where needed!

Forking Requirements
---------------------
I don't personally mind if you fork PITC mew as your own AI as long as in your credits you drop a small message saying where your project was forked from!
